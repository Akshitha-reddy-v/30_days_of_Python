# In Python, when we want to get some data from the user
# We prompt the user for an input using the function input()
# Say, we are trying to log into a website.
# We require username and password as the inputs from user.
name = input("Please enter your name : ")
username = input("Enter username : ")
password = input("Enter password : ")
print("Hello, "+name+" :)")

# We can store database of a student trying to participate in a sports event
